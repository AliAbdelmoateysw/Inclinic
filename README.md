# Inclinic
Andriod_Application 

Using Java

Idea: 
Inclinc is android application that provide  multiple services and  the main target to provide care that never ends.
there where 3 dimensions for the application:
First the client view or patient view:
  the patient register and login then choose one of the following services:
    first diagnosis in that part the client choose which body part has the illness or harm him. then answer many questions that act as actual diagnose then get a conclusion
    what illness he has and how to manipulate it with the first aid processes or could he see a doctor or go to the closest pharmacist and tell him the diagnose.
    Second part call medical analysis that take a medical analysis report and analyze it and get a conclusion for the patient what the percentage means for him and what he 
    had and how to deal with this.
    Third part call case analysis that include a previous data of the patients what they had  and their ages and heath status if they had any disease and also how could they 
    cure from the disease. Patient could learn from it or add his experience then our admins review it then accept it or reject it.
    Fourth part give the power to  patient to book a doctor. He view  many doctors with the location, rating and  the price. Book the doctor he wants and pay with differenet 
    ways. could  pay with credit card or  when he arrive at doctor's. if he cancel the reservation when he pay with the credit card we take  20% of booking price to give it to 
    the doctor otherwise he has 3 trials to book the third time he cancel we block him.
   
Second view is  the doctor's:
  the doctor register and login then wait for admin to give him the permission by reviewing his certificates and ensure that he is a real doctor. when it  happen he get a notification
  that he is accepted and please add your information like the price, location, time and pictures. then he had offers from patients he could review them and  accept what he want from them.
  
Third and last view is the admin's:
  Admin can manipulate all the above and update the percentages of medical analysis and the ways of diagnose.  there is also a dashboard can see the progress of the application.
